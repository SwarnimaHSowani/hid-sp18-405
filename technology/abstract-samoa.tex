\section{Apache Samoa}
Apache Samoa, which stands for Scalable Advanced Massive Online Analysis, is a distributed streaming machine learning framework that contains a programing abstraction for distributed streaming machine learning algorithms. It features a pluggable architecture that allows it to run on several distributed stream processing engines such as Storm, S4, and Samza~\cite{samoa-web}.Real time analytics using tools like Samoa is becoming the fastest and most efficient way to obtain useful knowledge from what is happening now, allowing organizations to react quickly when problems appear or to detect new trends helping to improve their performance~\cite{samoa-MUSE}. Apache Samoa users can develop distributed streaming ML algorithms once and execute them on multiple DSPEs. Samoa is written in Java, is open source under the Apache Software License version 2.0~\cite{samoa-JMLR}.
