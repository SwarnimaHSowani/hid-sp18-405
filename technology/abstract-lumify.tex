\section{Lumify}
Lumify is an open source project developed at US national security contractor Altamira, featured with 
big data fusion, analysis, and visualization platform. ``Its intuitive web-based interface helps users 
discover connections and explore relationships in their data via a suite of analytic options, including 2D 
and 3D graph visualizations, full-text faceted search, dynamic histograms, interactive geographic 
maps, and collaborative workspaces shared in real-time''~\cite{hid-sp18-405-www-lumify}. Lumify has 
an Open Layers-compatible mapping system which can be utilized by tools like Google Maps to display 
an interactive geospatial analysis of the data set, which provides a much more direct and intuitive 
visualization on geospatial related analysis. Further, Lumify was recently integrated with SAP's high 
speed HANA in-memory database and computation engine, which enables faster data retrieval and 
calculation speed compared to the use of conventional database 
system~\cite{hid-sp18-405-linkedinblog-lumify}.
