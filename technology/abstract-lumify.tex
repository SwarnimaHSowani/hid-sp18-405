\section{Lumify}
Lumify is an open source project big data fusion, analysis, and visualization
platform. Its intuitive web-based interface helps users discover connections
and explore relationships in their data via a suite of analytic options,
including 2D and 3D graph visualizations, full-text faceted search, dynamic
histograms, interactive geographic maps, and collaborative workspaces shared in
real-time.\cite{lumify-web} Lumify features an Open Layers-compatible mapping
system that can drive the likes of Google Maps to display an interactive
geospatial analysis of the data set. It was recently integrated with SAP's
high speed HANA in-memory database and computation engine. Lumify was developed
at US national security contractor Altamira and the software project's Web
site uses a deep dive into terrorist organization al Qaeda to showcase its
detective abilities.\cite{lumify-linkedin}
