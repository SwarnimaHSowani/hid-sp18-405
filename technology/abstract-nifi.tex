\section{Apache NiFi}
Apache NiFi (short for NiagaraFiles) is a software project from the Apache
Software Foundation designed to automate the flow of data between software
systems. It is based on the ``NiagaraFiles'' software previously developed by
the NSA and open-sourced as a part of its technology transfer program in
2014~\cite{hid-sp18-405-wiki-nifi}. NiFi's fundamental design concepts
closely relate to the main ideas of Flow Based Programming. This design model
provides many beneficial consequences that help NiFi to be a very effective
platform for building powerful and scalable dataflows. Apache NiFi supports
powerful and scalable directed graphs of data routing, transformation, and
system mediation logic~\cite{hid-sp18-405-wwwoverview-nifi}. Some of the
high-level capabilities and objectives of Apache NiFi include: Web-based
user interface, Highly configurable, Data Provenance, Designed for extension
and Secure~\cite{hid-sp18-405-www-nifi}.
