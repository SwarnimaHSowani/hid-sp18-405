\section{Stardog}
Stardog is the smart graph database from US-software company Complexible. Stardog has a particular 
focus on OWL and RDF-based systems, with the latest release Stardog 5.2 (9 January 2018) supports 
SPARQL query language; property graph model and Gremlin graph traversal language; OWL 2 and 
user-defined rules for inference and data analytics; virtual graphs; geospatial query answering;and 
programmatic interaction via several languages and network 
interfaces~\cite{hid-sp18-405-wwwdocs-stardog}. Further, the developers of StarDog OWL/RDF DBMS 
have pioneered a new use of OWL as a schema language for RDF databases. This is achieved by adding 
integrity constraints (IC), also expressed in OWL syntax, to the traditional ``open-world'' OWL 
axioms~\cite{hid-sp18-405-cer2012graphical-stardog}. Featured customers include NASA, JP Morgan 
Chase and Viacom. Stardog is priced for community, developer and enterprise tiers, with community 
free to download and use for up to four users and ten databases~\cite{hid-sp18-405-www-stardog}.
