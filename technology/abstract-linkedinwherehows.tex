\section{LinkedIn WhereHows}

LinkedIn WhereHows is a open source project carried out by the LinkedIn Data team. The project works 
by creating a central repository and portal for the processes, people, and knowledge around the data, 
which is the an important element of any big data system~\cite{hid-sp18-405-www-wherehows}. The 
repository has captured the status of 50 thousand datasets, 14 thousand comments, 35 million job 
executions and related lineage information~\cite{hid-sp18-405-www-wherehows}. WhereHows 
integrates with all LinkedIn data processing environments and extracts metadata before offering this 
piece of information through two interfaces: one is a web application which facilitates navigation, 
search, lineage visualization, annotation, discussion, and community participation; the other is 
an API endpoint that empowers automation of other data processes and 
applications~\cite{hid-sp18-405-www-wherehows}. The name WhereHows comes from the  two 
important aspects of the data: \textbf{where} is the data, and \textbf{how} is it produced and 
consumed~\cite{hid-sp18-405-githubwiki-wherehows}.
