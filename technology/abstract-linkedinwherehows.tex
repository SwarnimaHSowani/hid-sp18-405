\section{LinkedIn WhereHows}

WhereHows, a project of the LinkedIn Data team, works by creating a central repository and portal for the processes, people, and knowledge around the most important element of any big data system: the data itself. The repository has captured the status of 50 thousand datasets (with more than 15 petabytes storage footprint across multiple Hadoop, Teradata and other clusters), 14 thousand comments, 35 million job executions and related lineage information.\cite{ wherehows-web} WhereHows integrates with all LinkedIn data processing environments and extracts coarse and fine grain metadata from them. Then, it surfaces this information through two interfaces: (1) a web application that enables navigation, search, lineage visualization, annotation, discussion, and community participation and (2) an API endpoint that empowers automation of other data processes and applications.\cite{wherehows-wiki}
