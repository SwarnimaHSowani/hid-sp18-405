# This is for Assignment: Cloud and Big Data Rest Service with Swagger

## Service Descprition
I was trying to build a service with Natural Language Processing capabilities which takes English sentences as input and returns various linguistic features. This may lead towards the final project in this course.

In the current implementation, I allow the request to specify sentences in the uri and the response will include the following features: 
    * tokens
    * part of speech taggings
    * dependency parsing results
    * named entity recognition
