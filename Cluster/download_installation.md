# This is a short note for downloading and putting raspbian on an SD card
* The instruction I followed is at [instructions](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/)
* I am using MacOS

## Download 
* download page is [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/)
* I chose raspbian instead of NOOBs, but I haven't looked into which one we are gonna use. I suppose it is raspbian.
* Within raspbian, there are two versions, RASPBIAN STRETCH WITH DESKTOP and RASPBIAN STRETCH LITE. I downloaded them both

## Writing an image to the SD card 
(some steps are copied from [instructions](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/))
* Followed the instructions at the beginning, I downloaded and installed [Etcher](https://etcher.io/)
* Connect an SD card reader with the SD card inside (My macbook actually have one SD reader directly)
* Open Etcher and select from hard drive the Raspberry Pi .img or  .zip file to write to the SD card. (I chose the RASPBIAN STRETCH LITE here)
* Select the SD card to write the image to.
* Review selections and click 'Flash!' to begin writing data to the SD card.

## Will need to check if the SD card works for the purpose in Friday's lab.
